0,"Lives up to its name.Barring the incident at the door where I was asked to carry my own luggage towards the staff whilst he just stood there like a lump and not even offering to help which I thought was rude and just demonstrated callousness on his part , the stay was pleasant.Breakfast was good.Hygiene was good and rooms were excellent.  Always great to be a guest at Taj."
1,"A great and warm experience, even in these tough times. A level apart in hospitality. Courteousness of staff is commendable. Had a wonderful experience and would love to come back in future and take a warm shower in Tajness."
2,everything superb. All health and hygiene protocols are being strictly followed in all areas.Food little expensive but the service quality somewhat compensates it.Hospitality and Courtesy at its Best.
3,my stay at Taj Place Hotel was awesome as always. the staff was friendly. Drinks at Blue Bar was great and the captain kitchen Breakfast was good though i missed the style of earlier Buffet Breakfast and the energy there. Looking for the better times ahead in a few months
4,"It was great to experience the Taj Hospitality as a welcome back guest. We loved the decor of the hotel. Our check-in experience was awesome with minimal waiting time all because of Arpan. He is the best person in his work. The cleanliness in the room were beyond our expectations. We were offered a room with an amazing view of the hotel's pool.However, the key highlight has to be hospitality extended during breakfast. The staff was extremely courteous and made us feel special during the entire experience even while working under tough conditions during COVID time. Will definitely visit this property again."
