0,Terrific purchase,"first of all with mi 18 watt charger,it got full charged in 20mins.that was amazing and 16-18hrs playtime is best at this price range.I searched for a wireless earphone and bought many but finally settled with this.sound quality is good but build quality is premium.overall i would say it is the best earphone to go with and I guarantee you will not regret.drop like if you find it useful."
1,Worth every penny,"LONG BUT WORTH READING.Honest review after one week. Just go for it. Dont get affected by negative reviews. Totally worth every penny and far ahead of its competition. The battery backup is splendid. Sound quality is very good nothing to complain here. Comfortable in the ears. Connectivity perfect. I haven't experienced any lag with normal media usage. I am a student and watch video lectures at sometimes 2x speed and never once I faced voice lag while changing video speed. Just go for it. Just for 200 ‚Çπ settling for realme would be bit foolish. Highly recommended for students and someone whose main purpose is consuming media, or people who use for calling and phone meetings etc. I believe most of us won'teven notice that bass is quite low if we dont listen to reviewsWhen not to buy- Bass is actually bit low no doubt and if you are a bass addict it might ruin your experience. If you are someone for whom bass is extremely necessary like athletes or professional music mixers etc, and you are prepared to compromise 20hr of battery life and quick charging for bass, then realme would be a better option for you."

3,Terrific purchase,"1. Packaging is very good.2. When comes to build quality no one surpassed OnePlus.3. Battery backup is awesome if you have 30W OnePlus or realme charger then sone pe suhaga..4. No one talking about warranty. It gives 1 year whereas it's competitor realme wireless buds gives 6 months warranty.5. Now comes to main point .. As it offers 9 mm driver bass is some how  low than realme buds wireless (11.2 mm ). But trible, mid tone and high tone is very good.6. Other features like low latency mode, quick switch, water resistance is given. Comfort is at next level.So above points may help you to choose between OnePlus and realme wireless buds. I will definitely choose OnePlus over realme .. But if you want only bass then ....."

8,Terrific,THIS ONE IS OUTSTANDING...few months before if some one ask me WITCH IS THE BEST VALUE FORE MONY WIRELESS EARPHON in the market I will definitely go for the SONY....JBL...or.....REALME                But now it the oneplus BULLET WIRELESS Z I will give you my thoughts and features of this earphon from my 3 days of usage BUILD QUALITY : the build quality of this earphon was good..combination of good plastic materials and some fiber......if you enjoy music or whatever no problems that it will not crack IF YOU USE IT WHILE LYING IN THE BED SOUND QUALITY: If you are heavy bass lover dont go fore this one. the bass of this wireless earphon is well balanced guys.....but the sound quality in top volume was crisp and clear.Also call quality is best level....no issues when calling someoneWIRELESS RANGE: as they saying this one had a wireless range of about 10 feet.in my test it was actually more greater than 10 feet...also no prob with that..Bluetooth version 5..AND one can pare this earphon to 2 devices that pared presently in quick time BATTERY BACKUP: this one has an amazing battery backup. i was using it in the box condition  fore about three days till the rivew and now it was showing about 30% battery remainingFrom the type c port u can easily charge it and this one supports warp charge  10 min charge 10 hour play back full charge about 20 hours (this was from the oneplus and I am not tested this. I will update more about this after one month)FORE PUB G LOVERS: If buying this one fore pub  g mobile I will not suggest this one fore those who....and the low latency mood was only work with oneplus devices not in any other phons and the sound was actually lags in other brandsPACKAGING : The packaging from oneplus is high level..this one comes in premium packaging like the oneplus phons FINAL WORDS: All the above features are just fore 1999.and it was from the oneplus family   SO WHAT YOU THINKING IT WAS THE WRITE TIME TO PICK THIS ONE JUST GO FORE IT
9,Pretty good,"By now u have seen 100's of review by now ... Everything u have read is true ... 5/5 in all but not in bass... If u havnt brought and u r a base head pls look for different headset but like me if u r stuck with this there is A FIX TO BASS.... SIMPLY CHANGE THE EAR TIP TO LARGER SIZE ... It improves the bass significantly at the cost of slight discomfort .... It works .. trust me Pls upvote this comment , So more people can improve the bass"
